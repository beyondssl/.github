## Our products - for your better and safer world.

### 🌐 SparkView
> ZTNA and Remote Security Access

[Visit product page →](https://www.beyondssl.com/en/products/sparkview/)

SparkView is the hobbyhorse with which many current security problems in SMEs and enterprises are solved. SparkView acts as a kind of middleware and is installed in the company's internal network (or DMZ) on a Windows, Linux or Apple server. Targets such as (virtual) desktops, applications (e.g. ERP, CRM) or servers can then be defined and access rights assigned to individual users on the targets. Users can be created locally or integrated via Active Directory/LDAP/RADIUS. Users access the destinations exclusively via the browser. This means that any end device with a browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge) can be used. Since no data is transferred to the end device, private devices can also be used without any problems. Nothing needs to be installed on the end device.
